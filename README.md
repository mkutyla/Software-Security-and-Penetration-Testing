# Software-Security-and-Penetration-Testing
Software Security and Penetration Testing projects. 

## Projects in Polish:
Projects starting with a number were conducted during Polish studies at Warsaw University of Technology, hence the reports are written exclusively in Polish (besides #1, as it contains a short README in English instead of a standalone report). Collaborators for these projects include:
* Miłosz Kutyła, BEng, Warsaw University of Technology, ([GitHub](https://github.com/mkutyla))
* Jakub Ossowski, BEng, Warsaw University of Technology, ([GitHub](https://github.com/bilevcik))
* Patryk Jankowicz, BEng, Warsaw University of Technology ([GitHub](https://github.com/PatrykSJ))
* Jan Walczak, BEng, Warsaw University of Technology ([GitHub](https://github.com/JanWalczak))

## Projects in English
Project X is written in English as a simple vulnerability overview.
