# Buffer-Overflow
This repository contains an example of how a buffer overflow vulnerability can be exploited using Python. The goal of this challenge is to get access to the flag that is being read from 'flag.txt' by causing a buffer overflow.

'exploit.py' is the code of the exploit.

'task1' is the code that is being exploited with exploit.py.

'task1.c' is the source code of 'task1'.

'flag.txt' contains the flag.
